1. library defined in contract file
2. library imported from weblink
3. library imported from installed module
3.1 handle multiple imports to compare library import file with using library name

4. function with only one library function should work
5. function with only 2 library function should show both functions
5.1 works if both have ElementaryTypeName
5.2 doesn't work if one is ElementaryTypeName and other UserDefinedTypeName(like struct member)
6. function using struct having interger variable using library function is not showing like requestCount.add(1) and
   aProposal.approvalCount = aProposal.approvalCount.add(1);
	 basically not able to read user defined struct members
7. signerCount.mul(100).div(2) ==> for this it detects only mul and not div
